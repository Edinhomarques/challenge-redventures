# challenge-redventures
Frontend job opportunity 


# Submission (Junior Level)
- hello guys, here's my submission for the challenge, i apologize now because i couldn't do much of what was proposed. The time given was very long but I am unable to dedicate myself most days, but still follows my solution.

# How tu run?
- I used create-react-app because it is more practical, when cloning this repository in the frontend directory:
- run  yarn 
 
## and then run: 
 - yarn start


## Not solution
I didn't get to make any requests because the way I put together the solution I didn't know how to pass the states of the screens related to the quantity of light, water and if there is a pet or not to the screen that would make the request and display the plants request.But I would use axios to make requests, and because it is a request in an api, I would use o "useEffet" do hooks because to async of js.

this is it, thank you for atention and opportunity!!
